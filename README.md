# Project: Contacts-manager

**Contacts-manager** - This SPA website is built on React for adding, deleting,
and searching contacts . [View project](https://goit-react-hw-08-pink-seven.vercel.app/)

**API** - I used the [Custom APi](https://connections-api.goit.global), I used
this API for: registration, authorization, saving tokens, receiving contacts.
[documentation API](https://connections-api.goit.global/docs/)

### Project structure

The structure consists of pages: home, contacts, registration, authorization, and components, as well as
the site also uses Redux-Persist technology to store contacts after the page reloads.
Private and public routing techniques are used, and the “react-helmet” library was used to improve SEO.
